# TilemapEd
TilemapEd is a tilemap editor for the Commander X16 retro computer.

(It's not currently complete, but is being worked on)

It uses C++17 and SDL2, SDL2_image and SDL2_ttf.

A copy of Nerdfonts TTF fonts are included in the repo according to [LICENSE.nerdfonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/LICENSE)

TilemapEd uses Dear ImGui for UI. A copy of the license is included in the repo [LICENSE.ImGui](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocornut/imgui/master/LICENSE.txt)     
[LICENSE.ImGuiFileDialog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aiekick/ImGuiFileDialog/Lib_Only/LICENSE)     

Run "cmake CMakeLists.txt" to configure and then "make" to build in \*nix.      
In Windows in MSYS2 run "cmake --build . " to build.

To setup SDL2 in MSYS2 follow this guide [msys2-SDL2-Setup.md](https://gist.github.com/thales17/fb2e4cff60890a51d9dddd4c6e832ad2)
